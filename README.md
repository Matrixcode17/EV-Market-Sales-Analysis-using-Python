Market size analysis is a crucial aspect of market research that determines the potential sales volume within a given market. It helps businesses understand the magnitude of demand, assess market saturation levels, and identify growth opportunities.
For the task of market size of electric vehicles analysis, we can explore the following areas:

EV Adoption Over Time: Analyze the growth of the EV population by model year.
Geographical Distribution: Understand where EVs are most commonly registered (e.g., by county or city).
EV Types: Breakdown of the dataset by electric vehicle type (BEV, etc.).
Make and Model Popularity: Identify the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.
Electric Range Analysis: Analyze the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.
Estimated Growth in Market Size: Analyze and find the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles.

The results of the above problem statements are shown in the google colab notebook which can be acessed for analysis purposes.
